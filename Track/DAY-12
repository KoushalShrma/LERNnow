DAY-12

Aaj ka kaam (YouTube API Integration - Phase 2: Search & Discovery)

1) YouTube Search Implementation
- YouTubeService me comprehensive search functionality:
  - searchEducationalVideos() method with keyword-based search
  - Educational video filtering with category ID 27 (Education)
  - Search query enhancement: "tutorial programming learn" append karta hai
  - High definition video preference aur relevance-based ordering

2) YouTube Video Statistics Integration
- fetchVideoStatistics() method add kiya:
  - Video duration parsing from PT4M20S format to seconds
  - View count aur engagement metrics collection
  - Content details API call for comprehensive data
  - Error handling for statistics fetch failures

3) Curated Video Discovery
- Topic-specific video search:
  - getVideosByTopic() method with predefined search queries
  - Subject-wise optimization: "java", "python", "react", "spring boot"
  - Intelligent query building for better search results

4) Popular Channel Integration
- getPopularProgrammingVideos() method:
  - Curated list of educational channels: CodeWithHarry, Apna College, etc.
  - Random channel selection for diverse content discovery
  - Quality content filtering from trusted sources

5) Duration Parsing Logic
- parseDurationToSeconds() utility method:
  - ISO 8601 duration format parsing (PT4M20S)
  - Proper error handling for malformed duration strings
  - Fallback to 0 seconds for unparseable durations

Testing Done
- YouTube search working with real API calls.
- Video statistics fetching successfully.
- Duration parsing accurate for various formats.
- Popular channel content discovery functional.

Next Steps (DAY-13)
- YouTube Controller endpoints banane hai.
- Frontend-ready API responses design karna hai.
- Error handling aur rate limiting improve karna hai.
