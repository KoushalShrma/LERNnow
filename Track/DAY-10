DAY-10

Aaj ka kaam (Learning Path System & Structured Learning)

1) LearningPath Controller Implementation
- LearningPathController banaya with full path management:
  - POST /api/learning-paths/user/{userId} → create custom learning path
  - GET /api/learning-paths/user/{userId} → user ke saare paths
  - GET /api/learning-paths/{pathId} → specific path details
  - PUT /api/learning-paths/{pathId} → update path information
  - DELETE /api/learning-paths/{pathId} → remove learning path

2) Topic Association with Learning Paths
- Many-to-Many relationship implementation:
  - POST /api/learning-paths/{pathId}/topics/{topicId} → add topic to path
  - DELETE /api/learning-paths/{pathId}/topics/{topicId} → remove topic from path
  - Path me topics ka proper ordering aur sequence

3) Public Learning Paths
- Community sharing features:
  - GET /api/learning-paths/public → public paths for all users
  - GET /api/learning-paths/popular → most followed paths
  - isPublic flag for sharing learning journeys with community

4) Path Filtering & Discovery
- Advanced search capabilities:
  - GET /api/learning-paths/filter/purpose/{purpose} → filter by purpose
  - GET /api/learning-paths/filter/language/{language} → language-based filter
  - Purpose types: UPSKILL, JOB_INTERVIEW, CAREER_CHANGE, LEARNING

5) Learning Path Analytics
- Path completion tracking:
  - Progress calculation across all topics in path
  - Estimated completion time based on user's learning speed
  - Path difficulty assessment based on included topics

6) Path Recommendation Engine (Basic)
- LearningPathService me recommendation logic:
  - User ke completed topics analyze kar ke similar paths suggest karta hai
  - Skill level ke basis pe appropriate paths recommend karta hai

Testing Status
- Learning path creation aur management working.
- Topic association with paths functional.
- Public path discovery implemented successfully.

Next Steps (DAY-11)
- YouTube API integration start karna hai.
- External video content fetch karna hai.
- API dependencies add karna hai.
